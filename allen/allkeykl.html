        with the most violent opposition from prejudice and ignorance, which its wonderful
        theraputic powers have slowly, yet surely overcome. It was successfully used by Dioscorides,
        Pliny, and Sextus in ancient times, and revived in New York by Reisig, Bayard and Swan in
        the treatment of diphtheria. Reised was the first to potentize it.</p>

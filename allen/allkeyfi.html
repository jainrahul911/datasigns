        &gt; by external heat; heat <font color="#800000"><i>without thirst</i></font>, &lt; by
        covering ( &gt; by covering, Nux). Complaints return at precisely the same hour. Ignatia
        bears the same relation to the diseases of women that Nux does to sanguine, bilious men.
        There are many more Ignatia persons in North America than Nux vomica persons - Hering.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Relations</b></font>. - Incompatible: Coff.,

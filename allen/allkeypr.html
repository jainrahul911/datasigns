          the fourth. The facet that a fourth is demanded is convincing proof
          that Dr. Allen left an indestructible monument of homeopathic materia
          medica, on that is true to Homeopathy and immensely helpful to every
          physician who consults it.<br>

          Edition</big></font></big></p>
          </b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">The first edition of this book was only about half
          the size of the second, as it was prepared somewhat hastily for a
          special purpose, but Dr. Allen took his time to the second edition and
          gave the world a well rounded out and complete standard book on
          homeopathic materia medica. We do no mean that the first edition was
          faulty as to its matter, for is was used unchanged in the later
          edition, but it did not embrace a sufficient number of remedies. As
          Dr. Allen died before a third edition was needed we concluded to bring
          it out unchanged. It is a masterpiece of materia medica work: its
          symptomatology is made up of the unchanging landmarks of our remedies
          that are in constant use; it is, in short, a book that needs no
          revision.</p>

          Edition</big></font></big></p>
          </b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">In preparing the second edition for the press the
          work has been enlarged and practically rewritten. Many more remedies
          have been included and symptoms and comparisons extended, yet care has
          been taken that every symptom has been verified. The original plan has
          been maintained, viz., to give only those symptom-guides that mark the
          individuality of the remedy. that the student of materia medica may
          use them as landmarks to master the genius of the remedial agent.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">At the suggestion of the publisher and in response
          to numerous enquiries a more extended symptomatology of the nosodes
          has been included, for these invaluable additions to our
          armamentarium, like the so-called tissue remedies of Schuessler, only
          need more extensive provings to place them in the list of polychrests.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">That the student may acquire that correct
          pronunciation of our remedial agents an alphabetical list of remedies
          with the accentuation is given, for a homeopathic physician may
          properly be held accountable for the correct use of the terms peculiar
          to his profession. An index of remedies and comparisons is also
          included.</p>

          <b>
          <p align="CENTER"><big><font color="#004080"><big>Preface : First
          Edition</big></font></big></p>
          </b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">The life-work of the student of homoeopathic
          Materia Medica is one of constant comparison an differentiation. He
          must compare the pathogenesis of a remedy with the recorded anamnesis
          of the patient; he must differentiate the apparently similar symptoms
          of two or more medical agents in order to select the simillinum. To
          enable the student or practitioner to do this correctly and rapidly he
          must have as a basis for comparison, some knowledge of the <i>individuality</i>
          of the remedy; something that is <i>peculiar, uncommon</i>, or
          sufficiently <i>characteristic</i> in the confirmed pathogenesis of a
          polychrest remedy that may be used as a pivotal point of comparison.
          It may be a so-called &quot;keynote,&quot; a
          &quot;characteristic,&quot; the &quot;red strand of the rope,&quot;
          and central modality or principle as the aggravation of Bryonia, the
          amelioration from motion of Rhus, the furious, vicious delirium of
          Belladonna or the apathetic indifference of Phosphoric acid - some
          familiar landmark around which the symptoms may be arranged in the
          mind for comparison.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">Something of this kind seems indispensable to
          enable us to intelligently and successfully use our voluminous
          symptomatology. Also, if we may judge from the small number of
          homeopathic physicians who rely on the single remedy in practice, and
          the almost constant demand for a &quot;revision&quot; of the Materia
          Medica, its study in the past, as well as at present, has not been
          altogether satisfactory to the majority.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">An attempt to render the student's task less
          difficult, to simplify its study, to make it both interesting and
          useful, to place its mastery within the reach of every intelligent man
          or woman in the profession, is the apology for the addition of another
          monograph to our present works of reference.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">It is all-important that the first step in the
          study of homeopathic therapeutics be correctly taken, for the pathway
          is then more direct and the view more comprehensive. The object of
          this work is to aid the student to master that which is guiding and
          characteristic in the individuality of each remedy and thus utilize
          more readily the symptomatology of the Homoeopathic Materia Medica,
          the most comprehensive and practical work for the cure of the sick
          ever given the medical profession. It is the result of years of study
          as student, practitioner and teacher, and is published at the earnest
          solicitation of many alumni of Hering College, with the hope that it
          may be of as much benefit to the beginner as it has been to the
          compiler.</p>

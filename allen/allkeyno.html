        crowing at great distance keep her awake. Loss of breath on falling asleep (Grind., Lach.). <font

        sphincter. (In Stramonium we have suppression; while in Opium the secretion is not
        diminished, the bladder is full but fullness is unrecognized.). Opium renders the intestines
        so sluggish that the most active purgatives lose their power. - Hering. Persistent diarrhoea
        in those treated with large doses of the drug. - Lippe. Sudden retrocession of acute
        exanthema results in paralysis of brain or convulsions (Zinc.). Marasmus; child with

        doses; strong coffee, Nux, <font color="#800000"><i>Kali per</i></font>. and constant

        </big>Monkshood (Ranunculacea.)</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is generally indicated in acute or recent cases occurring in young
        persons, especially girls, of a full, plethoric habit <font color="#800000"><i>who lead a
        sedentary life</i></font>; persons easily affected by atmospheric changes; dark hair and
        eyes, rigid muscular fibre. Complaints caused by exposure to <font color="#800000"><i>dry
        cold air, dry north or west winds</i></font>, or exposure to draughts of cold air while in a
        perspiration; bad effects of checked perspiration. <font color="#ff0000"><b>Great fear and
        anxiety of mind</b></font>, with great nervous excitability; afraid to go out, to go into a
        crowd where there is any excitement or many people; to cross the street. The countenance is
        expressive of <font color="#ff0000"><b>fear</b></font>; <font color="#800000"><i>the life is
        rendered miserable by fear</i></font>; is sure his disease will prove fatal; predicts the
        day he will die; fear of death during pregnancy. Restless, anxious, does everything in great
        haste; must change position often; everything startles him. Pains; are intolerable, they
        drive him crazy; he becomes very restless; at night. Hahnemann says: &quot;Whenever Aconite
        is chosen homeopathically, you must, above all, observe the moral symptoms, and be careful
        that it closely resembles them; the anguish of mind and body; the restlessness; the disquiet
        not to be allayed.&quot;. This mental anxiety, worry, fear accompanies the most trivial
        ailment. Music is unbearable, makes her sad (Sab., during menses, Nat. c.). On rising from a
        recumbent position the red face becomes deathly pale, or he becomes faint or giddy and
        falls, and fears to rise again; often accompanied by vanishing of sight and unconsciousness.
        Amenorrhoea in plethoric young girls; after fright, to prevent suppression of menses. For
        the congestive stage of inflammation before localization takes place. Fever; <font
        color="#ff0000"><b>skin dry and hot</b></font>; face red, or pale and red alternately; <font
        color="#800000"><i>burning thirst for large quantities of cold water</i></font>; <font
        color="#ff0000"><b>intense nervous restlessness, tossing about in agony</b></font>; becomes
        intolerable towards evening and on going to sleep. Convulsions; of teething children; heat,
        jerks and twitches of single muscles; child gnaws its fist, frets and screams; skink hot and
        dry; high fever. Cough, croup; dry, hoarse, suffocating, loud, rough, croaking; hard,
        ringing, whistling; on <font color="#800000"><i>expiration</i></font> (Caust. - on
        inhalation, Spong.); <font color="#ff0000"><b>from dry, cold winds or drafts of air</b></font>.
        Aconite should never be given simply to control the fever, never alternated with other drugs
        for that purpose. If it be a case requiring Aconite no other drug is needed; Aconite will
        cure the case. Unless indicated by the exciting cause, is nearly always injurious in first
        stages of typhoid fever.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Aggravation</b></font>. Evening and night, pains
        are insupportable; in a warm room; when rising from bed; lying on affected side (Hep., Nux

        Mag. c., Puls., Sab.).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Relationship</b></font>. Complementary: to
        Coffea in fever, sleeplessness, intolerance of pain; to Arnica in traumatism; to Sulphur in
        all cases. Rarely indicated in fevers which bring out eruptions. Aconite is the acute of
        Sulphur, and both precedes and follows it in acute inflammatory conditions.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Adapted to torpid, phelgmatic persons; the hydrogenoid constitution (of
        Grauvogl). Diseases originating from exposure in damp basements or cellars (Ars., Aran.,
        Tereb.). Through the pneumogastric nerve it depresses the respiration and circulation, thus
        producing the keynote of the remedy, viz., <font color="#800000"><i>when the patient coughs
        there appears to be a large collection of mucus in the bronchi</i></font>; it seems as if
        much would be expectorated, but nothing comes up. Child clings to those around; wants to be
        carried; cries and whines if any one touches it; will not let you feel the pulse (Ant. c.,
        Sanic.). <font color="#800000"><i>Face cold, blue, pale, covered with cold sweat</i></font>
        (Tab.). Tongue coated pasty, thick, white, with reddened papillae and red edges; red in
        streaks; very red, dry in the middle; <font color="#800000"><i>extraordinary craving for
        apples</i></font> (Aloe- for acids, pickles, Ant. c.). Vomiting: in any position except
        lying on right side; until he faints; followed by <font color="#800000"><i>drowsiness and
        prostration</i></font>; of cholera morbus with diarrhoea and cold sweat, a dose after each
        attack (Ver.). Asphyxia: mechanical, as apparent death from drowning; from mucus in bronchi;
        from impeding paralysis of lungs; from foreign bodies in larynx or trachea; with <font
        color="#800000"><i>drowsiness and coma</i></font>. <font color="#800000"><i>Great sleepiness
        or irresistible inclination to sleep</i></font>, with nearly all complaints (Nux m., Op.).
        Child at birth pale, breathless, gasping; asphyxia neonatorum. Relieves the &quot;death
        rattle&quot; (Taran.). Icterus with pneumonia, especially of right lung.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Relations</b></font>. - Similar: to Lycopodium;
        but spasmodic motion of the alae is replaced by dilated nostrils; to Veratrum, both have
        diarrhoea, colic, vomiting, coldness and craving for acids; to Ipecac, but more drowsiness
        from defective respiration; nausea, but &gt; after vomiting. When lungs seem to fail,
        patient becomes sleepy, cough declines or ceases, it supplants Ipec. For bad effects of
        vaccination when Thuja fails and Silicea is not indicated. Before Silicea in dyspnoea from
        foreign bodies in the larynx or trachea; Puls. in suppressed gonorrhoea; Tereb. from damp
        basements. Children not easily impressed when Ant. tart. seems indicated in coughs, require
        Hepar. In spring and autumn, when damp weather commences, coughs of children get worse.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Aggravation</b></font>. - In damp, cold weather;
        lying down at night; warmth of room; change of weather in spring (Kali s., Nat. s.).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Amelioration</b></font>. - Cold open air;
        sitting upright; expectorating; lying of right side (Tab.).</p>
